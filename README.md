# Implementing_SLAM
This is a self-learning project that leads to the first step in understanding and analyzing the performance of self-driven robots and cars using Reinforcement learning. Simultaneous Localization And Mapping or SLAM is the most common way that helps the agent predict and learn from its surroundings, to take the steps in its journey towards goal. This is basically implemented using different kinds of sensors and actuators such as LIDAR , gyro and so on, in the state of the art models. Being a fan of AI and its application and a student who takes his first step towards Deep learning and Neural networks, I'm trying to implement it using Python code in way that mimics SLAM. This basically does with two steps : 1. Maps the surroundings or room to create an idea about the area which it is in.   2.  Creating a co-ordinate system with the area and localizing itself within the map, using the information that it got from the surrounding during mapping (Step 1).
